# Spring Sumobot Competition!!!

The Spring semester sumobot competition will always be a staple of Villanova
IEEE. That said, thank you for being one of its participants! This README
outlines aspects of the workshop and provides helpful links to get started with
assembling and programming your bot.

## Instructions

All of the real, pertinent instructions can be found in
[Pololu's 32U4 Robot User Guide](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63). The most
important sections of this guide are [Section 4](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/4)
and [Section 5](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/5), which cover assembly and
programming of the bot, respectively.

**Read the instructions carefully!** It is very easy to miss some of the steps
and all of them are very important to finishing the bot. Don't skip over lines,
it's jam packed with information!

### Do NOT plug your bot into your PC until you have installed the drivers

Driver installation is extremely important. **If you connect your bot to your
PC via USB before installing the drivers, you will brick the bot and be unable
to connect**. See driver installation in [Section 5.1](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/5.1).

Once the driver's are installed you may read [Section 5.2](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J63/5.2)
on programming and will eventually install the necessary dependencies for
working with the 32U4.

**We recommend working through the provided example code and adding your own
tweaks**, but if you would just like some code that will work for you come
competition day, flash the `SumoProximitySensors` example from
**File > Examples > Zumo32U4 > SumoProximitySensors**.
