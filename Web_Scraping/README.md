# IEEE Web Scraping Workshops

Each workshop has its own respective `README.md` detailing its function.
Reference any of the other markdown files for steps on installing python and
NodeJS or the basics of web scraping.

- [INSTALLS.md](./INSTALLS.md)
- [SCRAPE.md](./SCRAPE.md)

## Future Steps

Implement your own conditions to suit your needs.

- Do you want to truly automate this and be notified on a timer?
  - Use the `time` library in Python or Date functions in Javascript to
    notify yourself daily, weekly, etc. Or use Task Scheduler and a shell script
    to run your code as often as needed.
  - Buy a Raspberry Pi, run the code and throw it in a desk drawer so it's
    always running.
- Do you want to be notified when prices drop?
  - Set up global variables to store the prices and only email if they dropped
    since the last query.
