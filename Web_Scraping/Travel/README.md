Download the chrome driver from:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Download python:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download nodejs:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

(I would recommend using node-version-manager over a download of nodejs because its easier to manage long-term):
Mac/Linux: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases

(use the nvm-setup.zip file for Windows install)
