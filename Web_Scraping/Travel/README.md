Download the chrome driver from:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Download python:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download nodejs:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

But I recommend downloading NVM to use for nodejs:
MAC/Linux: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
Windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases

for nvm-windows, use the nvm-setup.zip file
